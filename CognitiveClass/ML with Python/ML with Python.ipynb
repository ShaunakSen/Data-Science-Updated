    "#### ML vs Stat Modelling:\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is an algorithm that can learn from data without being reliant on std programming practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Stat modeling is the formulization of rel bw vars in form of mathematical eqns\n",
    "\n",
    "It is subfield of maths\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is subfield of CS and AI\n",

    "Naming conventions:\n",

    "**Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "In SL, we have a set of training data, or labeled data in which we know the structure and outcome of it\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./data/img/diag3\" height=\"500\" width = \"500\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We take this data and train a ML model, so that it can understand patterns in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model has been trained we can use it to predict out-of-sample data,or data in which the results are unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./data/img/diag4\" height=\"500\" width = \"500\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are given data which is unstructured, we can use USL to find patterns in that data\n",
    "\n",
    "**SL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We \"teach\" a model, ie we load the model with knowledge so that it can predict future instances\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we \"teach\" a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- We teach it by training it with some data from a **labeled** dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "eg: Iris dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./data/img/diag5\" height=\"500\" width = \"500\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 types of SL:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**USL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We **do not** supervise the model, but we let the model work on its own to discover info that may not be visible to the human eye\n",
    "\n",
    "UL uses ML algos that draw conclusions on **unlabeled data**\n",
    "\n",
    "** Difficulties of USL vs SL **:\n",
    "\n",
    "- USL has more difficult algos, since we know little to no info about the data, or the outcomes that are to be expected\n",
    "\n",
    "- With USL we are trying to find things such as Groups or Clusters, Density Estimations, and Dim Redn\n",
    "\n",
    "- USL has fewer tests and models to ensure that outcome of model is accurate\n",
    "    As such, USL creates a **less controllable** env as machine is creating outcomes for us\n",
    "    \n",
    "- SL deals with labeled data, USL with unlabeled data\n",
    "    \n",
    "Eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./data/img/diag6\" height=\"500\" width = \"500\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can see an op of an algo applied to examining poisonous mushrooms \n",
