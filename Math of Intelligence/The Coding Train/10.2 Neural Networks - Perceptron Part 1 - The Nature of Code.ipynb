    "\n",
    "There is a single neuron. It receives 2 ips (X0 and X1). These ips come into the neuron. Some type of mathematical process happens in the neuron and then there is an op (Y)\n",

    "If B, we tweak the algo to try and get the correct answer. This tweaking is a process called Gradient Descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the algo that runs inside the neuron\n",
    "\n",
