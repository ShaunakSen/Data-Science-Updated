    "\n",
    "There is some sort of Input. That ip goes into some ML recipe (algorithm). Out of that ML recipe we get an op.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 common kinds of op:\n",

    "\n",

    "We have to train the system, apply some sort of learning method to the system\n",

    "- **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here we have traing data and test data. Also we have unknown data. We have training data with the labels/response variable. The inputs go into the ML recipe and come out of the other side and some sort of guess is made. So for house price pred say y_actual = 1 mil and y_predicted = 1.5 mil. So ML recipe got it wrong. So we turn some knobs in the recipe to get a better result and minimize error. We do this over and over again with lots of training data. Then we have test data. Test data is similar to training data - ips with corr ops. But we didnt use it while training. So we feed test data and see how well it does and evaluate its performance. If good we publish it out to the world to interact with the unknown data \n",

    "- **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is generally applied to data that we know nothing about. It is typically applied to CLustering problems. Say we have lots of data and we want to arrange it in groups and we dont know anything about the data. The algo figures out the clusters based on the patterns in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a kind of learning where an agent observes the environment and chooses an action. Think of a mouse trying to get through a maze. The mouse looks around and finds walls. Say mouse decides to go Left.Once it makes that decision, it receives a reward, positive or negative. As mouse receives more positive rewards for certain kinds of actions, it does more of those actions over the long term and gets better and better at things\n",
