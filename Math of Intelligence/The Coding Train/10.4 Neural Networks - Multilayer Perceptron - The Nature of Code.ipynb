    "\n",
    "We had a caanvas full of pts and there was a line separating the 2 classes of pts. We had a simple perceptron trying to learn that line\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario looked like this:\n",

    "![](./data/img/diag20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this not enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if we want any number of ips to generate any number of ops**. This is very common in many ML applications.\n",
    "Let us take a very classic classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a handwritten digit (say 8). I have all of the pixels (28x28) of that digit. These pixels (784 greyscale values) will be the ips to the Perceptron. The op will be a set of probabilities as to which digit it is\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag21.png)\n",

    "But we can simply have a whole bunch of ips, a whole bunch of ops but a single processing unit - Why cant we do that?\n",

    "A single Perceptron can only solve **linearly separable problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we used a Perceptron in our prev example to classify the data we were dealing with a linearly separable prob. This means that it was possible to draw a st line that separated the 2 classes of data\n",

    "If it was in 3d I could put a plane and that would also be linearly separable because we can divide the space in half\n",

    "#### Simple use case for a Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the Boolean expr A && B and see the truth table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag23.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a linearly seoparable prob as shown by the dotted line in the diagram\n",

    "This mean we can create a Perceptron with 2 ips which can be T or F and an op\n",
    "\n",
    "Same thing for A || B\n",
    "\n",
    "OR is also linearly separable\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can have Perceptrons learn to do A&&B and A||B\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag24.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another bool expr called XOR. Its only true if one is T and one is F\n",
    "\n",
    "However it is not possible to draw a single line to divide the Ts and Fs\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag25.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**So XOR is not a linearly separable prob**\n",
    "\n",
    "However we can draw **2 lines** to separate the Ts and Fs. That means a single simplest Perceptron cannot solve a simple operation like XOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag26.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a perceptron that knows how to solve AND. If AND is linearly separable !AND ie **NAND** is also LS\n",
    "Also we have another perceptron that knows how to solve OR\n",
    "\n",
    "**More complex probs that are not linearly separable can be solved by liking multiple perceptrons together**\n",

    "Suppose A and B are the ips \n",

    "The !AND or NAND computes $\\overline{AB}$\n",

    "The OR computes $A + B$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final AND does\n",

    "In the diag it is a 3 layered NN\n",
    "\n",
    "There is the ip layer, op layer and the hidden layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Hidden layer consists of the neurons that sit bw the ips and ops. They are called hidden because the user of the system does not see them. The user simply feeds in data and looks at the op. But the hidden layer is where the magic happens. This hidden layer is what allows us to get around the LS constraint. More hidden layers, more neurons, more complexity, more wts and params that need to be tweaked.\n",
