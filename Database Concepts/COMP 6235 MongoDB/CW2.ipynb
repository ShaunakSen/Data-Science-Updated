    "This coursework will assess your understanding of using NoSQL to store and retrieve data.  You will perform operations on data from the Enron email dataset in a MongoDB database, and write a report detailing the suitability of different types of databases for data science applications.  You will be required to run code to answer the given questions in the Jupyter notebook provided, and write a report describing alternative approaches to using MongoDB.\n",

You do not need to set up any authentication.  In the Jupyter notebook provided, perform the following tasks, using the Python PyMongo library.\n",
