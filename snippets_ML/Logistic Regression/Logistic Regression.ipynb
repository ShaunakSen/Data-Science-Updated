    "We review LinReg first\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fit a best fit line to our data using LinReg we can do the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of LogReg\n",
    "\n",
    "LogReg is similar to LinReg, but it predicts something as True/False instead of predicting something continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "LogReg does not fit a line to the data, it fits an \"S\" shaped curve called the Logistic Function\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve goes from 0 to 1\n",
    "It basically gives the **prob that the mouse is obese based on its weight**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wt a v heavy mouse there is a high prob that the mouse is obese\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if we wt an intermediate mouse there is only 50% chance that the mouse may be obese\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly there is only a small prob that a light mouse may be obese\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although LogReg tells the prob that a mouse is obese or not, it is usually used for Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "If prob that mouse is obese > 50% then we classify it as obese, else not obese\n",
    "\n",
    "Here this is a very simple model where obesity is predicted by weight\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have more complex models where obesity is predicted by weight + genotype + age + alstrological sign + ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Just like LinReg, LogReg can also work with both cont and discrete data**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also test to see if each var is useful for predicting obesity\n",
    "\n",
    "However ** unlike LinReg we cant easily compare the complicated model to the simple model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we just see if a var's effect on a predn is significantly diff from 0. If not means that the var is not helping the predn. We use \"**Wald's Test**\" to figure this out \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we fit the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In LinReg we fit the line using **Least Squares**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the line that min the sum of squares for these residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the residuals to compute R^2 to compare simple models to complicated models\n",
    "\n",
    "LogReg does not have the same concept of a residual, so it cant use Least Squares and cant calculate R^2\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses **Maximum Likelihood**\n",

    "\n",
    "- It makes it easier to work with and is also more general, it applies to every experiment of the same type\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we think that the wts may be normally distributed. That means we think **it came** from a Normal Dist\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Dist characteristics:\n",

    "We pick any ND and check how it fits the data\n",

    "In this case its diff from the avg of the actual measurements\n",
    "Here most of the values are far from the avg of the ND\n",
