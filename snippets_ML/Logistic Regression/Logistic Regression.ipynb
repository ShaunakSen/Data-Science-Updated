    "We review LinReg first\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fit a best fit line to our data using LinReg we can do the following things:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overview of LogReg\n",
    "\n",
    "LogReg is similar to LinReg, but it predicts something as True/False instead of predicting something continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "LogReg does not fit a line to the data, it fits an \"S\" shaped curve called the Logistic Function\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve goes from 0 to 1\n",
    "It basically gives the **prob that the mouse is obese based on its weight**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wt a v heavy mouse there is a high prob that the mouse is obese\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if we wt an intermediate mouse there is only 50% chance that the mouse may be obese\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly there is only a small prob that a light mouse may be obese\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although LogReg tells the prob that a mouse is obese or not, it is usually used for Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "If prob that mouse is obese > 50% then we classify it as obese, else not obese\n",
    "\n",
    "Here this is a very simple model where obesity is predicted by weight\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have more complex models where obesity is predicted by weight + genotype + age + alstrological sign + ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Just like LinReg, LogReg can also work with both cont and discrete data**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also test to see if each var is useful for predicting obesity\n",
    "\n",
    "However ** unlike LinReg we cant easily compare the complicated model to the simple model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we just see if a var's effect on a predn is significantly diff from 0. If not means that the var is not helping the predn. We use \"**Wald's Test**\" to figure this out \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we fit the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In LinReg we fit the line using **Least Squares**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./data/img/diag5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We find the line that min the sum of squares for these residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the residuals to compute R^2 to compare simple models to complicated models\n",
    "\n",
    "LogReg does not have the same concept of a residual, so it cant use Least Squares and cant calculate R^2\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses **Maximum Likelihood**\n",
    "\n",
